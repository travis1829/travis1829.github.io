I am a Master's student at KAIST School of Computing, currently advised by [Prof. Youngjin Kwon](https://sites.google.com/view/yjkwon/home).
From March 2024 to July 2025, I was also fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jeehoon Kang](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/jeehoon.kang/).

My research interests are in computer systems, especially operating systems and concurrency.
You can find my detailed CV [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A_6aqz38EPm8hSgbsrMIo9d7dt6MNZr6G-Hpmkl5Q6s/edit?usp=sharing).
